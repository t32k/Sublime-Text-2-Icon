Installation (Mac OS X)
------------

Open the following folder:

    open /Applications/Sublime\ Text\ 2.app/Contents/Resources/

Find the file `Sublime Text 2.icns` and replace with the one from this repository. The name needs to remain exactly the same.

If you want to replace the built-in document icons as well, copy all the .icns files from this project's `Document Icons` folder to the same folder as above. Doing so will overwrite the application's default icons, so you may want to back them up in case you'd like to restore them.`

Installation (Windows 7)
------------

Download [ResEdit](http://www.resedit.net/)

1.  Navigate to the installation folder for Sublime Text 2 (this should be in C:\Program Files\Sublime Text2). Copy `sublime_text.exe` to your desktop.*
2.  Run ResEdit, choose `File > Open Project ...`. Select the `sublime_text.exe` you copied to your desktop.
3.  In the Resources pane of ResEdit, right-click the Icon folder and choose `Add Resource > Icon...`.
4.  Navigate to the folder containing the `sublime_text.ico` file. Add it.
5.  Right-click the icon named `103 [English (Australia)]`, select `Remove from Project`.
6.  Save.
7.  Copy the `sublime_text.exe` on your desktop back to the Program Files folder from step 1.

* The Program Files folder is protected. You need to move the exe out of this folder to edit it.
